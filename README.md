# NYT-Sudoku-stats
Repository for stats of the NYT Sudoku that I started playing in 2026. 

## Scope
I want to have a good analysis of my plays, in particular how many plays, the average time for completing the puzzle, an histogram of my times and the evolution of my average time with more plays. 

## Contents
In the repository we found different files, this is a brief description of them. 
#### times.txt
Text file with the times of the plays, divided in the three difficulty (easy, medium, hard). This file should be periodically updated.
#### analysis.py
Python file to run the analysis.
#### README.dm
Obviously this readme.
